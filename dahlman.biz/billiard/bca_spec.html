<p>The BCA will sanction Tournament Play on Home and

<h3>Table Bed height:</h3>

<p>The table bed playing surface, when measured from the bottom
of the table leg, will be 29 1/4 minimum to 30 1/4 maximum. </p>

<h3>Pocket Openings and Measurements:</h3>

<p>Pocket billiard tables: pocket openings are measured at two
points - the first being measured between opposing cushion noses
where the direction changes into the pocket (tip to tip). This is
called the <b>mouth</b>. The second point of measurement is at
the narrowest point at the back of the facing. This is called the
<b>throat</b>.</p>

<p><b>Corner Pocket:</b><br>
Mouth.............................................................4
7/8&quot; minimum to 5 1/8&quot; maximum<br>

<p><b>Vertical Pocket Angle</b> 12 +,or - 1 degree</p>

<p><b>Shelf:</b> </p>

<p>The shelf is measured from the center of the imaginary line
that goes from one side of the mouth to the other where the nose
of the cushion changes direction to the center of the vertical
cut of the slate pocket radius. </p>

<p>Corner
Pocket..................................................1
5/8&quot; minimum to 1 7/8&quot; maximum<br>
Side
Pocket..............................................................0&quot;
minimum to 3/8&quot; maximum<br>
</p>

<p><b>Drop Point Slate Radius:</b> The pocket radius measured
from the vertical cut of the slate to the playing surface.</p>

<p>Drop Point Slate
Radius.................................1/8&quot; r. Minimum to
1/4&quot; r. Maximum<br>
</p>

<h3>Playing Bed:</h3>

<p>The playing surface must be capable, either by its own
strength or a combination of its strength and that of the table
baseframe, of maintaining an overall flatness within a tolerance
of .020&quot; lengthwise and .010&quot; across the width.
Further, this surface should have an additional deflection not to
exceed .030&quot; when loaded with a concentrated static force of
200 pounds at its center. If more than one slab is employed, the
slab joints must be in the same plane within .005&quot; after
leveling and shimming. The bed must be covered with a fabric, the
major portion of which is made of wool, with proper tension to
avoid unwanted ball roll-off. Commercial tables must have a
1&quot; - 3 piece set of slate with a wooden frame minimum
3/4&quot; attached to slate. All playing surfaces must be secured
to base frame with screws or bolts.<br>
</p>

<h3>Cushion:</h3>

<p>Rubber cushions should be triangular in shape and molded with
the conventional K-66 profile with a base of 1 3/16&quot; and a
nose height of 1&quot;, with control fabric molded to the top and
base area of the cushion. On carom billiard tables, the
triangular k-55 profile cushion is to be maintained, with the
control fabric on the underside of the cushion to effect a slower
rebound action. On snooker tables, the triangular k66 profile or
L-shaped snooker cushion is to be used. The balance of the rail
section to which the rubber cushion is glued should be of
hardwood construction and attached to the slate bed with a
minimum of three (3) heavy duty, threaded rail bolts per rail.<br>
</p>
