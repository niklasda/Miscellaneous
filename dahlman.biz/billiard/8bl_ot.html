<h2>Open Table Rule for 8-Ball</h2>

<p>This portion of the rules should not be considered an
amendment to the current rules for 8-Ball, but instead an
interpretation provided by Staff of the Billiard Congress of
America to better clarify the rule. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>10. OPEN TABLE.</b> (Defined) The table is
&quot;open&quot; when the choice of groups (stripes or solids)
has not yet been determined. When the table is open, it is legal
to hit a solid first to make a stripe or vice-versa. Note: The
table is always open immediately after the break shot. <i>When
the table is open it is legal to hit any solid or stripe or the
8-ball first in the process of pocketing the called stripe or
solid. However, when the table is open and the 8-ball is the
first ball contacted, no stripe or solid may be scored in favor
of the shooter.</i> The shooter loses his turn; any balls
pocketed remain pocketed; and the incoming player addresses the
balls with the table still open. On an open table, all illegally
pocketed balls remain pocketed.</p>

<p><b>&quot;When the table is open it is legal to hit any solid
or stripe or the 8-ball first in the process of pocketing the
called stripe or solid.&quot;</b></p>

<p>This is straight forward. It means that when the table is
open, any ball can be legally hit without resulting in a foul.
This is not a new rule for players in the United States.</p>

<p><b>&quot;When the table is open and the 8-ball is the first
ball contacted, no stripe or solid may be scored in favor of the
shooter.&quot;</b></p>

<p>This sentence may seem to contradict the first, but it
doesn't. It says that although it is legal to hit the 8-Ball
first on an &quot;open table&quot;, if a player does, he/she
forfeits their turn whether they pocketed something or not. There
is no foul, and the incoming player accepts the cue-ball in
position with the table still open.</p>

<p>This part of the rules is derived from the old European rule
where it is illegal to hit the 8-Ball first anytime during the
game.<br>
