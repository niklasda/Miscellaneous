<h2>General Rules of Pocket Billiards</h2>

<hr>

<p align="center">These general rules apply to all pocket
billiard games, UNLESS specifically noted to the contrary in the
individual game rules. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>1. TABLES, BALLS, EQUIPMENT</b>. All games described in
these rules are designed for tables, balls and equipment meeting
the standards prescribed in the BCA Equipment <a
href="bca_spec.html">Specifications </a>. </p>

<p><b>2. RACKING THE BALLS</b>. When racking the balls a triangle
must be used, and the apex ball is to be spotted on the foot
spot. All the balls must be lined up behind the apex ball and
pressed together so that they all have contact with each other. </p>

<p><b>3. STRIKING CUE BALL</b>. Legal shots require that the cue
ball be struck only with the cue tip. Failure to meet this
requirement is a foul. </p>

<p><b>4. FAILURE TO POCKET A BALL</b>. If a player fails to
pocket a ball on a legal shot, then the player's inning is over,
and it is the opponent's turn at the table. </p>

<p><b>5. LAG FOR BREAK</b>. The following procedure is used for
the lag for the opening break. Each player should use balls of
equal size and weight (preferably cue balls but, when not
available, non-striped object balls). With the balls in hand
behind the head string, one player to the left and one to the
right of the head spot, the balls are shot simultaneously to the
foot cushion and back to the head end of the table. The player
whose ball is the closest to the innermost edge of the head
cushion wins the lag. The lagged ball must contact the foot
cushion at least once. Other cushion contacts are immaterial,
except as prohibited below. </p>

<p>It is an automatic loss of the lag if: (1) the ball crosses
into the opponent's half of the table, (2) the ball fails to
contact the foot cushion, (3) the ball drops into a pocket, (4)
the ball jumps the table, (5) the ball touches the long cushion,
(6) the ball rests within the corner pocket and past the nose of
the head cushion, or (7) the ball contacts the foot rail more
than once. If both players violate automatic-loss lag rules, or
if the referee is unable to determine which ball is closer, the
lag is a tie and is replayed. </p>

<p><b>6. OPENING BREAK SHOT</b>. The opening break shot is
determined by either lag or lot. (The lag for break procedure is
required for tournament and other formal competition.) The player
winning the lag or lot has the choice of performing the opening
break shot or assigning it to the opponent. </p>

<p><b>7. CUE BALL ON OPENING BREAK</b>. The opening break shot is
taken with cue ball in hand behind the head string. The object
balls are positioned according to specific game rules. On the
opening break, the game is considered to have commenced once the
cue ball has been struck by the cue tip and crosses the head
string. </p>

<p><b>8. DEFLECTING THE CUE BALL ON THE GAMES OPENING BREAK</b>.
On the break shot, stopping or deflecting the cue ball after it
has crossed the head string and prior to hitting the racked balls
is considered a foul and loss of turn. The opponent has the
option of receiving cue ball in hand behind the head string or
passing the cue ball in hand behind the head string back to the
offending player. (Exception: ball in hand on the whole table:
see rule 1.3 for 9-Ball). A warning must be given that a second
violation during the match will result in the loss of the match
by forfeiture. (See Rule 28.) </p>

<p><b>9. CUE BALL IN HAND BEHIND THE HEAD STRING</b>. This
situation applies in specific games whereby the opening break is
administered or a player's scratching is penalized by the
incoming player having cue ball in hand behind the head string.
The incoming player may place the cue ball anywhere behind the
head string. </p>

<p>The shooting player may shoot at any object ball as long as
the base of the object ball is on or below the head string. He
may not shoot at any ball, the base of which is above the head
string, unless he first shoots the cue ball below the head string
and then by hitting a rail causes the cue ball to come back above
the head string and hit the object ball. The base of the ball
(the point of the ball touching the table) determines whether it
is above or below the head string. </p>

<p>If the incoming player inadvertently places the cue ball on or
below the head string, the referee or the opposing player must
inform the shooting player of improper positioning of the cue
ball before the shot is made. If the opposing player does not so
inform the shooting player before the shot is made, the shot is
considered legal. If the shooting player is informed of improper
positioning, he must then reposition the cue ball. If a player
positions the cue ball completely and obviously outside the
kitchen and shoots the cue ball, it is a foul, if called by the
opponent or referee. </p>

<p>When the cue ball is in hand behind the head string, it
remains in hand (not in play) until the player drives the cue
ball past the head string by striking it with his cue tip. </p>

<p>The cue ball may be ADJUSTED by the player's hand, cue, etc.,
so long as it remains in hand. Once the cue ball is in play per
the above, it may not be impeded in any way by the player; to do
so is to commit a foul. </p>

<p><b>10. POCKETED BALLS</b>. A ball is considered as a pocketed
ball if as a result of an otherwise legal shot, it drops off the
bed of the table into the pocket and remains there. (A ball that
drops out of a ball return system onto the floor is not to be
construed as a ball that has not remained pocketed.) A ball that
rebounds from a pocket back onto the table bed is not a pocketed
ball. </p>

<p><b>11. POSITION OF BALLS</b>. The position of a ball is judged
by where its base (or center) rests. </p>

<p><b>12. FOOT ON FLOOR</b>. It is a foul if a player shoots when
at least one foot is not in contact with the floor. Foot attire
must be normal in regard to size, shape and manner in which it is
worn. </p>

<p><b>13. SHOOTING WITH BALLS IN MOTION</b>. It is a foul if a
player shoots while the cue ball or any object ball is in motion
(a spinning ball is in motion). </p>

<p><b>14. COMPLETION OF STROKE</b>. A stroke is not complete (and
therefore is not counted) until all balls on the table have
become motionless after the stroke (a spinning ball is in
motion). </p>

<p>15<b>. HEAD STRING DEFINED</b>. The area behind the head
string does not include the head string. Thus an object ball that
is dead center on the head string is playable when specific game
rules require that a player must shoot at a ball past the head
string. Likewise, the cue ball when being put in play behind the
head string (cue ball in hand behind the head string), may not be
placed directly on the head string; it must be behind it. </p>

<p><b>16. GENERAL RULE, ALL FOULS</b>. Though the penalties for
fouls differ from game to game, the following apply to all fouls:
(1) player's inning ends; (2) if on a stroke, the stroke is
invalid and any pocketed balls are not counted to the shooter's
credit; and (3) any ball(s) is respotted only if the rules of the
specific game require it. </p>

<p><b>17. FAILURE TO CONTACT OBJECT BALL</b>. It is a foul if on
a stroke the cue ball fails to make contact with any legal object
ball first. Playing away from a touching ball does not constitute
having hit that ball. </p>

<p><b>18. LEGAL SHOT</b>. Unless otherwise stated in a specific
game rule, a player must cause the cue ball to contact a legal
object ball and then (1) pocket a numbered ball, or (2) cause the
cue ball or any numbered ball to contact a cushion. Failure to
meet these requirements is a foul. </p>

<p><b>19. CUE BALL SCRATCH</b>. It is a foul (scratch) if on a
stroke, the cue ball is pocketed. If the cue ball touches an
object ball that was already pocketed (for example, in a pocket
full of object balls), the shot is a foul. </p>

<p><b>20. FOULS BY TOUCHING BALLS</b>. It is a foul to strike,
touch or in any way make contact with the cue ball in play or any
object balls in play with anything (the body, clothing, chalk,
mechanical bridge, cue shaft, etc.) EXCEPT the cue tip (while
attached to the cue shaft), which may contact the cue ball in the
execution of a legal shot. Whenever a referee is presiding over a
match, any object ball moved during a standard foul must be
returned as closely as possible to its original position as
judged by the referee, and the incoming player does not have the
option of restoration. </p>

<p><b>21. FOUL BY PLACEMENT</b>. Touching any object ball with
the cue ball while it is in hand is a foul. </p>

<p><b>22. FOULS BY DOUBLE HITS</b>. If the cue ball is touching
the required object ball prior to the shot, the player may shoot
towards it, providing that any normal stroke is employed. If the
cue stick strikes the cue ball more than once on a shot, or if
the cue stick is in contact with the cue ball when or after the
cue ball contacts an object ball, the shot is foul. If a third
ball is close by, care should be taken not to foul that ball
under the first part of this rule. </p>

<p><b>23. PUSH SHOT FOULS</b>. It is a foul if the cue ball is
pushed by the cue tip, with contact being maintained for more
than the momentary time commensurate with a stroked shot. (Such
shots are usually referred to as push shots.) </p>

<p><b>24. PLAYER RESPONSIBILITY FOULS</b>. The player is
responsible for chalk, bridges, files and any other items or
equipment he brings to, uses at, or causes to approximate the
table. If he drops a piece of chalk, or knocks off a mechanical
bridge head, as examples, he is guilty of a foul should such an
object make contact with any ball in play (or the cue ball only
if no referee is presiding over the match). </p>

<p><b>25. ILLEGAL JUMPING OF BALL</b>. It is a foul if a player
strikes the cue ball below center (&quot;digs under&quot; it) and
intentionally causes it to rise off the bed of the table in an
effort to clear an obstructing ball. such jumping action may
occasionally occur accidentally, and such &quot;jumps&quot; are
not to be considered fouls on their face; they may still be ruled
foul strokes, if for example, the ferrule or cue shaft makes
contact with the cue ball in the course of the shot. </p>

<p><b>26. JUMP SHOTS</b>. Unless otherwise stated in rules for a
specific game it is legal to cause the cue ball to rise off the
bed of the table by elevating the cue stick on the shot, and
forcing the cue ball to rebound from the bed of the table. Any
miscue when executing a jump shot is a foul. </p>

<p><b>27. BALLS JUMPED OFF TABLE</b>. Balls coming to rest other
than on the bed of the table after a stroke (on the cushion top,
rail surface, floor, etc.) are considered jumped balls. Balls may
bounce on the cushion tops and rails of the table in play without
being jumped balls if they return to the bed of the table </p>

<p>under their own power and without touching anything not a part
of the table. The table shall consist of the permanent part of
the table proper. (Balls that strike or touch anything not a part
of the table, such as the light fixture, chalk on the rails and
cushion tops, etc., shall be considered jumped balls even though
they might return to the bed of the table after contacting items
which are not parts of the table proper). </p>

<p>In all pocket billiard games when a stroke results in the cue
ball or any object ball being a jumped ball off the table, the
stroke is a foul. All jumped object balls are spotted (except in
Nine Ball) when all balls have stopped moving. See specific game
rules for putting the cue ball in play after a jumped cue ball
foul. </p>

<p><b>28. SPECIAL INTENTIONAL FOUL PENALTY</b>. The cue ball in
play shall not be intentionally struck with anything other than a
cue's attached tip (such as the ferrule, shaft, etc.). While such
contact is automatically a foul under the provisions of Rule 19.,
if the referee deems the contact to be intentional, he shall warn
the player once during a match that a second violation during
that match will result in the loss of the match by forfeiture. If
a second violation does occur, the match must be forfeited. </p>

<p><b>29. ONE FOUL LIMIT</b>. Unless specific game rules dictate
otherwise, only one foul is assessed on a player in each inning;
if different penalties can apply, the most severe penalty is the
factor determining which foul is assessed. </p>

<p><b>30. BALLS MOVING SPONTANEOUSLY</b>. If a ball shifts,
settles, turns or otherwise moves &quot;by itself,&quot; the ball
shall remain in the position it assumed and play continues. A
hanging ball that falls into a pocket &quot;by itself&quot; after
being motionless for 5 seconds or longer shall be replaced as
closely as possible to its position prior to falling, and play
shall continue. </p>

<p>If an object ball drops into a pocket &quot;by itself&quot; as
a player shoots at it, so that the cue ball passes over the spot
the ball had been on, unable to hit it, the cue ball and object
ball are to be replaced to their positions prior to the stroke,
and the player may shoot again. Any other object balls disturbed
on the stroke are also to be replaced to their original positions
before the shooter replays. </p>

<p><b>31. SPOTTING BALLS</b>. When specific game rules call for
spotting balls, they shall be replaced on the table on the long
string after the stroke is complete. A single ball is placed on
the foot spot; if more than one ball is to be spotted, they are
placed on the long string in ascending numerical order, beginning
on the foot spot and advancing toward the foot rail. </p>

<p align="center"><img src="images/diag_3.gif" alt="Respotting Balls"
width="208" height="199"> </p>

<p>When balls on or near the foot spot or long string interfere
with the spotting of balls, the balls to be spotted are placed on
the long string as close as possible to the foot spot without
moving the interfering balls. Spotted balls are to be placed as
close as possible or frozen (at the referee's discretion) to such
interfering balls, except when the cue ball is interfering; balls
to be spotted against the cue ball are placed as close as
possible without being frozen. </p>

<p>If there is insufficient room on the long string between the
foot spot and the foot rail cushion for balls that must be
spotted, such balls are then placed on the extension of the long
string &quot;in front&quot; of the foot spot (between the foot
spot and the center spot), as near as possible to the foot spot
and in the same numerical order as if they were spotted
&quot;behind&quot; the foot spot (lowest numbered ball closest to
the foot spot). </p>

<p><b>32. JAWED BALLS</b>. If two or more balls are locked
between the jaws or sides of the pocket, with one or more
suspended in air, the referee shall inspect the balls in position
and follow this procedure: he shall visually (or physically if he
desires) project each ball directly downward from its locked
position; any ball that in his judgement would fall in the pocket
if so moved directly downward is a pocketed ball, while any ball
that would come to rest on the bed of the table is not pocketed.
The balls are then placed according to the referee's assessment,
and play continues according to specific game rules as if no
locking or jawing of balls had occurred. </p>

<p><b>33. ADDITIONAL POCKETED BALLS</b>. If extra balls are
pocketed on a legal scoring stroke, they are counted in accord
with the scoring rules for the particular game. </p>

<p><b>34. NON-PLAYER INTERFERENCE</b>. If the balls are moved (or
a player bumped such that play is directly affected) by a
non-player during the match, the balls shall be replaced as near
as possible to their original positions immediately prior to the
incident, and play shall resume with no penalty on the player
affected. If the match is officiated, the referee shall replace
the balls. This rule shall also apply to &quot;act of God&quot;
interference, such as earthquake, hurricane, light fixture
falling, power failure, etc. If the balls cannot be restored to
their original positions, replay the game with the original
player breaking. This rule is not applicable to 14.1 Continuous
where the game consists of successive racks: the rack in progress
will be discontinued and a completely new rack will be started
with the requirements of the normal opening break (players lag
for break). Scoring of points is to be resumed at the score as it
stood at the moment of game disruption. </p>

<p><b>35. BREAKING SUBSEQUENT RACKS</b>. In a match that consists
of short rack games, the winner of each game breaks in the next.
The following are common options that may be designated by
tournament officials in advance: (1) Players alternate break. (2)
Loser breaks. (3) Player trailing in games score breaks the next
game. </p>

<p><b>36. PLAY BY INNINGS</b>. During the course of play, players
alternate turns (innings) at the table, with a player's inning
ending when he either fails to legally pocket a ball, or fouls. </p>

<p>When an inning ends free of a foul, the incoming player
accepts the table in position. </p>

<p><a href="gen_of2r.html"><b>37. OBJECT BALL FROZEN TO CUSHION
OR CUE BALL</b></a>. This rule applies to any shot where the cue
ball's first contact with a ball is with one that is frozen to a
cushion or to the cue ball itself. after the cue ball makes
contact with the frozen object ball, the shot must result in
either (1) a ball being pocketed, or (2) the cue ball contacting
a cushion, or (3) the frozen ball being caused to contact a
cushion (not merely rebounding from the cushion it was frozen
to), or (4) another object ball being caused to contact a cushion
to which it was not already in contact with. Failure to satisfy
one of those four requirements is a foul. (Note: 14.1 and other
games specify additional requirements and applications of this
rule; see specific game rules.) </p>

<p>An object ball is not considered frozen to a rail unless it is
examined and announced as such by either the referee or one of
the players prior to that object ball being involved in a shot. </p>

<p><b>38. PLAYING FROM BEHIND THE STRING</b>. When a player has
the cue ball in hand behind the string (in the kitchen), he must
drive the cue ball to a point outside the kitchen before it
contacts either a cushion or an object ball. Failure to do so is
a foul if a referee is presiding over a match. If no referee, the
opponent has the option to call it either a foul or to require
the offending player to replay the shot again with the balls
restored to their positions prior to the shot (and with no foul
penalty imposed). </p>

<p>Exception: if an object ball lies on or outside the head
string (and is thus playable) but so close that the cue ball
contacts it before the cue ball is out of the kitchen, the ball
can be legally played. </p>

<p>If, with cue ball in hand behind the headstring and while the
shooter is attempting a legitimate shot, the cue ball
accidentally hits a ball behind the head string, and the cue ball
crosses the line, it is a foul. If with cue ball in hand behind
the head string, the shooter causes the cue ball to accidentally
hit an object ball, and the cue ball does not cross the
headstring, the following applies: the incoming player has the
option of calling a foul and having cue ball in hand, or having
the balls returned to their original position, and having the
offending player replay the shot. </p>

<p>If a player under the same conditions intentionally causes the
cue ball to contact an object ball behind the headstring, it is
unsportsmanlike conduct. </p>

<p><b>39. CUE BALL IN HAND FOUL</b>. During cue ball in hand
placement, the player may use his hand or any part of his cue
(including the tip) to position the cue ball. When placing the
cue ball in position, any forward stroke motion contacting the
cue ball will be a foul, if not a legal shot. </p>

<p><b>40. INTERFERENCE</b>. If the nonshooting player distracts
his opponent or interferes with his play, he has fouled. If a
player shoots out of turn, or moves any ball except during his
inning, it is considered to be interference. </p>

<p><b>41. DEVICES</b>. Players are not allowed to use a ball, the
triangle or any other width-measuring device to see if the cue
ball or an object ball would travel through a gap, etc. Only the
cue stick may be used as an aid to judge gaps, etc., so long as
the cue is held by the hand. To do so otherwise is a foul and
unsportsmanlike conduct. </p>

<p><b>42. ILLEGAL MARKING</b>. If a player intentionally marks
the table in any way to assist in executing the shot, whether by
wetting the cloth, by placing a cube of chalk on the rail, or by
any other means, he has fouled. If the player removes the mark
prior to the shot, no penalty is imposed. </p>
