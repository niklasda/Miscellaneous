<h2>9-BALL</h2>

<hr>

<p align="center"><b>[Standardized World Rules 1997]</b> </p>

<p align="center">Except when clearly contradicted by these additional rules,
the <a href="rls_gen.html">General Rules </a>of Pocket Billiards
apply.</p>

<hr>

<p><b>1 OBJECT OF THE GAME.</b> Nine Ball is played with nine
object balls numbered one through nine and a cue ball. On each
shot the first ball the cue ball contacts must be the
lowest-numbered ball on the table, but the balls need not be
pocketed in order. If a player pockets any ball on a legal shot,
he remains at the table for another shot, and continues until he
misses, fouls, or wins the game by pocketing the 9-ball. After a
miss, the incoming player must shoot from the position left by
the previous player, but after any foul the incoming player may
start with the cue ball anywhere on the table. Players are not
required to call any shot. a match ends when one of the players
has won the required number of games. </p>

<p><b>2. RACKING THE BALLS.</b> The object balls are racked in a
diamond shape, with the one ball at the top of the diamond and on
the foot spot, the nine ball in the center of the diamond, and
the other balls in random order, racked as tightly as possible.
the game begins with cue ball in hand behind the head string. </p>

<p><b>3. LEGAL BREAK SHOT.</b> The rules governing the break shot
are the same as for other shots except: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>a. The breaker must strike the 1-ball first and either
    pocket a ball or drive at least four numbered balls to the
    rail. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>b. If the cue ball is pocketed or driven off the table, or
    the requirements of the opening break are not met, it is a
    foul, and the incoming player has cue ball in hand anywhere
    on the table. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>c. If on the break shot, the breaker causes an object ball
    to jump off the table, it is a foul and the incoming player
    has cue ball in hand anywhere on the table. The object ball
    is not respotted (exception: if the object ball is the
    9-ball, it is respotted). </p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>4. CONTINUING PLAY.</b> On the shot immediately following a
legal break, the shooter may play a &quot;push out.&quot; (See
Rule 5.). If the breaker pockets one or more balls on a legal
break, he continues to shoot until he misses, fouls, or wins the
game. If the player misses or fouls, the other player begins his
inning and shoots until he misses, fouls, or wins. the game ends
when the nine ball is pocketed on a legal shot, or the game is
forfeited for a serious infraction of the rules. </p>

<p><b>5. PUSH OUT.</b> The player who shoots the shot immediately
after a legal break may play a push out in an attempt to move the
cue ball into a better position for the option that follows. On a
push out, the cue ball is not required to contact any object ball
nor any rail, but all other foul rules still apply. The player
must announce his intention of playing a push out before the
shot, or the shot is considered to be a normal shot. Any ball
pocketed on a push out does not count and remains pocketed except
the 9-ball. Following a legal push out, the incoming player is
permitted to shoot from that position or to pass the shot back to
the player who pushed out. A push out is not considered to be a
foul as long as no rule (except rules 7. and 8.) is violated. An
illegal push out is penalized according to the type of foul
committed. After a player scratches on the break shot, the
incoming player cannot play a push out. </p>

<p><b>6. FOULS.</b> When a player commits a foul, he must
relinquish his run at the table and no balls pocketed on the foul
shot are respotted (exception: if a pocketed ball is the 9-ball,
it is respotted). The incoming player is awarded ball in hand;
prior to his first shot he may place the cue ball anywhere on the
table. If a player commits several fouls on one shot, they are
counted as only one foul. </p>

<p><b>7. BAD HIT.</b> If the first object ball contacted by the
cue ball is not the lowest- numbered ball on the table, the shot
is foul. </p>

<p><b>8. NO RAIL.</b> If no object ball is pocketed, failure to
drive the cue ball or any numbered ball to a rail after the cue
ball contacts the object ball on is a foul. </p>

<p><b>9. IN HAND.</b> When the cue ball is in hand, the player
may place the cue ball anywhere on the bed of the table, except
in contact with an object ball. He may continue to adjust the
position of the cue ball until he takes a shot. </p>

<p><b>10. OBJECT BALLS JUMPED OFF THE TABLE.</b> An unpocketed
ball is considered to be driven off the table if it comes to rest
other than on the bed of the table. It is a foul to drive an
object ball off the table. The jumped object ball(s) is not
respotted (exception: if the object ball is the 9-ball, it is
respotted) and play continues. </p>

<p><b>11. JUMP AND MASSE SHOT FOUL.</b> If a match is not
refereed, it will be considered a cue ball foul if during an
attempt to jump, curve or masse the cue ball over or around an
impeding numbered ball, the impeding ball moves (regardless of
whether it was moved by a hand, cue stick follow-through or
bridge). </p>

<p><b>12. THREE CONSECUTIVE FOULS.</b> If a player fouls three
consecutive times on three successive shots without making an
intervening legal shot, he loses the game. The three fouls must
occur in one game. The warning must be given between the second
and third fouls. </p>

<p>A player's inning begins when it is legal for him to take a
shot and ends at the end of a shot on which he misses, fouls or
wins, or when he fouls between shots. </p>

<p><b>13. END OF GAME</b>. A game starts as soon as the cue ball
crosses over the head string on the opening break. The 1-ball
must be legally contacted on the break shot. The game ends at the
end of a legal shot which pockets the 9-ball; or when a player
forfeits the game as the result of a foul. </p>
