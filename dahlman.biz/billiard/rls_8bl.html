<p><b>1. OBJECT OF THE GAME.</b> Eight Ball is a call shot game
played with a cue ball and fifteen object balls, numbered 1
through 15. One player must pocket balls of the group numbered 1
through 7 (solid colors), while the other player has 9 through 15
(stripes). THE PLAYER POCKETING HIS GROUP FIRST AND THEN LEGALLY
POCKETING THE 8-BALL WINS THE GAME. </p>

<p><b>2. CALL SHOT.</b> In Call Shot, obvious balls and pockets
do not have to be indicated. It is the opponent's right to ask
which ball and pocket if he is unsure of the shot. Bank shots and
combination shots are not considered obvious, and care should be
taken in calling both the object ball and the intended pocket.
When calling the shot, it is NEVER necessary to indicate details
such as the number of cushions, banks, kisses, caroms, etc. Any
balls pocketed on a foul remain pocketed, regardless of whether
they belong to the shooter or the opponent. </p>

<p>The opening break is not a &quot;called shot.&quot; Any player
performing a break shot in 8-Ball may continue to shoot his next
shot so long as he has legally pocketed any object ball on the
break. </p>

<p><b>3. RACKING THE BALLS.</b> The balls are racked in a
triangle at the foot of the table with the 8-ball in the center
of the triangle, the first ball of the rack on the footspot, a
stripe ball in one corner of the rack and a solid ball in the
other corner. </p>

<p><b>4. ALTERNATING BREAK.</b> Winner of the lag has the option
to break. During individual competition, players will alternate
breaking on each subsequent game. </p>

<p><b>5. JUMP AND MASSE SHOT FOUL</b>. While &quot;cue ball fouls
only&quot; is the rule of play when a match is not presided over
by a referee, a player should be aware that it will be considered
a cue ball foul if during an attempt to jump, curve or masse the
cue ball over or around an impeding numbered ball that is not a
legal object ball, the impeding ball moves (regardless of whether
it was moved by a hand, cue stick follow-through or bridge). </p>

<p><b>6. LEGAL BREAK SHOT.</b> (Defined) To execute a legal
break, the breaker (with the cue ball behind the headstring) must
either (1) pocket a ball, or (2) drive at least four numbered
balls to the rail. If he fails to make a legal break, it is a
foul, and the incoming player has the option of (1) accepting the
table in position and shooting, or (2) having the balls reracked
and having the option of shooting the opening break himself or
allowing the offending player to rebreak. </p>

<p><b>7. SCRATCH ON A LEGAL BREAK.</b> If a player scratches on a
legal break shot, (1) all balls pocketed remain pocketed
(exception, the 8-ball: see rule 9), (2) it is a foul, (3) the
table is open. PLEASE NOTE: Incoming player has cue ball in hand
behind the head string and may not shoot an object ball that is
behind the head string, unless he first shoots the cue ball past
the headstring and causes the cue ball to come back behind the
headstring and hit the object ball. </p>

<p><b>8. OBJECT BALLS JUMPED OFF THE TABLE ON THE BREAK.</b> If a
player jumps an object ball off the table on the break shot, it
is a foul and the incoming player has the option of (1) accepting
the table in position and shooting, or (2) taking cue ball in
hand behind the head string and shooting. </p>

<p><b>9. 8-BALL POCKETED ON THE BREAK.</b> If the 8-ball is
pocketed on the break, the breaker may ask for a re-rack or have
the 8-ball spotted and continue shooting. If the breaker
scratches while pocketing the 8-ball on the break, the incoming
player has the option of a re-rack or having the 8-ball spotted
and begin shooting with ball in hand behind the headstring. </p>

<p><a href="8bl_ot.html"><b>10. OPEN TABLE.</b></a> (Defined) The
table is &quot;open&quot; when the choice of groups (stripes or
solids) has not yet been determined. When the table is open, it
is legal to hit a solid first to make a stripe or vice-versa.
Note: The table is always open immediately after the break shot.
When the table is open it is legal to hit any solid or stripe or
the 8-ball first in the process of pocketing the called stripe or
solid. However, when the table is open and the 8-ball is the
first ball contacted, no stripe or solid may be scored in favor
of the shooter. The shooter loses his turn; any balls pocketed
remain pocketed; and the incoming player addresses the balls with
the table still open. On an open table, all illegally pocketed
balls remain pocketed. </p>

<p><b>11. CHOICE OF GROUP.</b> The choice of stripes or solids is
not determined on the break even if balls are made from only one
or both groups. THE TABLE IS ALWAYS OPEN IMMEDIATELY AFTER THE
BREAK SHOT. The choice of group is determined only when a player
legally pockets a called object ball after the break shot. </p>

<p><b>12. LEGAL SHOT.</b> (Defined) On all shots (except on the
break and when the table is open), the shooter must hit one of
his group of balls first and (1) pocket a numbered ball, or (2)
cause the cue ball or any numbered ball to contact a rail. </p>

<p>PLEASE NOTE: It is permissible for the shooter to bank the cue
ball off a rail before contacting his object ball; however, after
contact with his object ball, an object ball must be pocketed, OR
the cue ball or any numbered ball must contact a rail. Failure to
meet these requirements is a foul. </p>

<p><b>13. &quot;SAFETY&quot; SHOT.</b> For tactical reasons a
player may choose to pocket an obvious object ball and also
discontinue his turn at the table by declaring &quot;safety&quot;
in advance. A safety shot is defined as a legal shot. If the
shooting player intends to play safe by pocketing an obvious
object ball, then prior to the shot, he must declare a
&quot;safety&quot; to his opponent. If this is NOT done, and one
of the shooter's object balls is pocketed, the shooter will be
required to shoot again. Any ball pocketed on a safety shot
remains pocketed. </p>

<p><b>14. SCORING. </b>A player is entitled to continue shooting
until he fails to legally pocket a ball of his group. After a
player has legally pocketed all of his group of balls, he shoots
to pocket the 8-ball. </p>

<p><b>15. FOUL PENALTY.</b> Opposing player gets cue ball in
hand. This means that the player can place the cue ball anywhere
on the table (does not have to be behind the headstring except on
opening break). This rule prevents a player from making
intentional fouls which would put his opponent at a disadvantage.
With &quot;cue ball in hand,&quot; the player may use his hand or
any part of his cue (including the tip) to position the cue ball.
When placing the cue ball in position, any forward stroke motion
contacting the cue ball will be a foul, if not a legal shot.
(Also see Rule 39 in the <a href="rls_gen.html">General Rules </a>of
Pocket Billiards) </p>

<p><b>16. COMBINATION SHOTS.</b> combination shots are allowed;
however, the 8-ball cannot be used as a first ball in the
combination except when the table is open. </p>

<p><b>17. ILLEGALLY POCKETED BALLS.</b> An object ball is
considered to be illegally pocketed when (1) that object ball is
pocketed on the same shot a foul is committed, or (2) the called
ball did not go in the designated pocket, or (3) a safety is
called prior to the shot. Illegally pocketed balls remain
pocketed. </p>

<p><b>18. OBJECT BALLS JUMPED OFF THE TABLE.</b> If any object
ball is jumped off the table, it is a foul and loss of turn,
unless it is the 8-ball, which is a loss of game. Any jumped
object balls are spotted in numerical order according to General
Rules for spotting balls. </p>

<p><b>19. PLAYING THE 8-BALL.</b> When shooting at the 8-ball, a
scratch or foul is not loss of game if the 8-ball is not pocketed
or jumped from the table. Incoming player has cue ball in hand.
Note: A combination shot can never be used to legally pocket the
8-ball. </p>

<p><b>20. LOSS OF GAME.</b> A player loses the game if he commits
any of the following infractions: </p>

<blockquote>
    <p>a. Fouls when pocketing the 8-ball (exception: see 8-Ball
    Pocketed On The Break). </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>b. Pockets the 8-ball on the same stroke as the last of
    his group of balls. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>c. Jumps the 8-ball off the table at any time. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>d. Pockets the 8-ball in a pocket other than the one
    designated. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>e. Pockets the 8-ball when it is not the legal object
    ball. </p>
</blockquote>

<blockquote>
    <p>Note: All infractions must be called before another shot
    is taken, or else it will be deemed that no infraction
    occurred. </p>
</blockquote>

<p><b>21. STALEMATED GAME.</b> If, after 3 consecutive turns at
the table by each player (6 turns total), the referee judges (or
if no referee, both players agree) that attempting to pocket or
move an object ball will result in loss of game, the balls will
be reracked with the original breaker of the stalemated game
breaking again. The stalemate rule may only be used when there
are only two object balls and the 8-ball remaining on the table.
PLEASE NOTE: Three consecutive fouls by one player is not a loss
of game. </p>
