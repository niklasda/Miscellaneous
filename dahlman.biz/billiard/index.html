<h1 align="center">World Standardized Rules</h1>

<hr>

<p>Cue Sports have exploded worldwide! Organizing the expansion
in the numbers of people playing, and standardizing the formats
and rules being used for the greater amount of competitions have
become a necessary and responsible challenge.</p>

<p>The World Confederation of Billiard Sports delivered the
first-ever official application for recognition of cue sports to
the International Olympic Committee in Lausanne, Switzerland, in
September, 1992. Since that time the Billiard Congress of America
(representing the various federations of North America) has
worked in cooperation with the other confederations of WPA - the
European Pocket Billiard Federation (representing 24 national
federations), the Asian Pocket Billiard Union (representing 7
national federations), and the Astralasian Pool Association
(representing 2 national federations) to produce the first-ever
world standardized rules for the major tournament games: </p>

<pre>
	<b>English		German		Spanish</b>

	<a href="rls_8bl.html">Eight Ball</a>		<a href="rls_8bl.html">Acht Ball</a>		<a href="rls_8bl.html">Bola Ocho</a>
	<a href="rls_9bl.html">Nine Ball</a>		<a href="rls_9bl.html">Neun Ball</a>		<a href="rls_9bl.html">Bola Nueve</a>
	<a href="rls_141.html">14.1 Continuous</a>	<a href="rls_141.html">14/1 Endlos</a>	<a href="rls_141.html">14.1. Continuo</a>
</pre>

<p>In order to promote the standardized rules throughout the
various countries and languages, a moratorium on future rules
changes is necessary. With the consistency in rules now
stabilized in the three most prevalent &quot;competition&quot;
games in the sport, the BCA in cooperation with the mandates of
the World Pool-Billiard Association has agreed on a moratorium on
changes to the rules for a period of 5 years - through the end of
1998.</p>

<p>The WPA Board and the annually held WPA General Assembly will
consider amendments to the rules, but only in proposals
strengthening the textual interpretation of a rule so it is
better understood - not a change in the spirit of the rule
itself.</p>

<p>The Billiard Congress of America is proud to make these rules
available on the Internet. You will find that the interest of the
sport is best served both recreationally and competitively when
you play by the official rules.</p>
