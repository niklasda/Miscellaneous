<h2>Object Ball Frozen to Cushion or Cue Ball</h2>

<p>This portion of the rules should not be concidered an
amendment to the current rules for 8-Ball, but instead an
interpretation provided by Staff of the Billiard Congress of
America to better clarify the rule. </p>

<hr>

<p><b>37. OBJECT BALL FROZEN TO CUSHION OR CUE BALL</b>. This
rule applies to any shot where the cue ball's first contact with
a ball is with one that is frozen to a cushion or to the cue ball
itself. after the cue ball makes contact with the frozen object
ball, the shot must result in either (1) a ball being pocketed,
or (2) the cue ball contacting a cushion, or (3) the frozen ball
being caused to contact a cushion (not merely rebounding from the
cushion it was frozen to), or (4) another object ball being
caused to contact a cushion to which it was not already in
contact with. Failure to satisfy one of those four requirements
is a foul. (Note: 14.1 and other games specify additional
requirements and applications of this rule; see specific game
rules.) </p>

<p>An object ball is not considered frozen to a rail unless it is
examined and announced as such by either the referee or one of
the players prior to that object ball being involved in a shot.
For this rule the use of the word &quot;cushion&quot; should be
intrepreted as rail. Because there are technically 6 cushions and
only 4 rails on a Pocket Billiard Table, this rule can be
misunderstood.</p>

<p>This is to say that it is illegal to cause a ball frozen to a
cushion on a long rail to cross in front of the side pocket of
that rail and come in contact with the other cushion. It is
illegal because the frozen ball was not driven to another rail.<br>
