<h2>Rules of Snooker</h2>

<p><b>Type of Game:</b> International or &quot;English&quot;
snooker is the most widely played form of snooker around the
world. It is generally played on 6'x12' English billiard tables,
with cushions that are more narrow than on pocket billiard tables
and which curve smoothly into the pocket openings. 5 x 10 and
snooker tables of even smaller playing dimensions may be used for
the game. On a 6 x 12 snooker (English billiard) table the
playing area within the cushion faces shall measure 11' 8.5&quot;
x 5' 10&quot; with a tolerance on both dimensions of
+/-0.5&quot;. The height of the table is measured from the floor
to the top of the cushion rail, and the height shall measure
34&quot; with an allowable variance of +/-0.5&quot;.</p>

<p>Players: 2</p>

<p><b>Balls Used:</b> Set of Snooker balls: fifteen object balls
that are not numbered and are solid red (called reds), six object
balls of other colors that are not numbered (called colors) and a
cue ball (called the white ball). Point values for object balls:
red-1, yellow-2, green-3, brown-4, blue-5, pink-6, black-7. In
International Snooker the balls used are 2-1/16&quot; diameter.</p>

<p><b>The Rack:</b> Play begins with the balls placed as in
diagram 14. The pink is spotted on the Pyramid Spot. The apex
ball of the triangle of reds is racked as close as possible to
the pink without touching it.</p>

<p><b>Baulk-line and Baulk:</b> A straight line drawn 29&quot;
from the face of the bottom cushion and parallel to it is called
the Baulk-line and the intervening space termed the Baulk.</p>

<p><b>The Half Circle:</b> The Half Circle is a semi-circle
described in Baulk with its center at the middle of the
Baulk-line and with a radius of 11.5&quot;. When the striker has
cue ball in hand within the Half Circle he may place the base of
the cue ball anywhere on the line or within the Half Circle, and
may use his hand or any part of his cue (including the tip) to
position the cue ball--as long as it is judged he is not
attempting to play a stroke.</p>

<p><b>Object of the Game:</b> To score a greater number of points
than opponent.</p>

<p><b>Scoring:</b> Points are scored in two ways: players are
awarded points for fouls by the opponent (see Penalties For Fouls
below), and by legally potting reds or colors. Each legally
potted red ball has a point value of one; each legally potted
color ball has a point value as indicated (Balls Used above). A
frame ends when all balls have been potted, following the Rules
of Play; if, however, only the black (7) ball is left on the
table, the frame ends with the first score or foul. If the
players' scores are equal after that scoring, the black is
spotted on its original position and the layers lag or draw lots
for the choice of playing at, or assigning opponent to play at,
the black ball with the cue ball in hand within the Half Circle,
first score or foul then ends the frame.</p>

<p><b>Opening Break:</b> Players lag or draw lots for choice of
break in the opening frame. In a match format the players
alternate the break in subsequent frames. Starting player has cue
ball in hand within the Half Circle. He must cause the cue ball
to contact a red ball. It is not necessary to send a ball to a
rail or into a pocket. Failure to meet this requirement is a foul
(see Penalties For Fouls) A foul is scored and--with all
fouls--the incoming player has a choice of (1) accepting the
table and becoming the striker, or (2) requiring the offender to
break again.</p>

<h2>Rules of Play</h2>

<p><b>1.</b> A legally potted ball entitles the striker to continue at
the table until he fails to legally pot a ball.</p>

<p><b>2.</b> On all shots, the striker must comply with the appropriate
requirements of Rules of Play 5 and 6. It is not necessary to
cause the cue ball or an object ball to contact a cushion or drop
in a pocket after the cue ball has contacted a legal object ball
(ball on). Failure to contact a legal object ball first is a
foul.</p>

<p><b>3.</b> As long as reds are on the table, the incoming striker
(player taking his first stroke of an inning) always has a red as
his legal object ball (ball on).</p>

<p><b>4.</b> Any red balls potted on a legal shot are legally potted
balls; the striker need not call any particular red ball(s),
pocket(s) or details of how the pot will be played.</p>

<p><b>5.</b> When the striker has a red ball as his &quot;ball on&quot;
(legal object ball), he must cause the cue ball's first contact
to be with a red ball. Failure to do so is a foul (See Penalties
For Fouls)</p>

<p><b>6.</b> After the striker has scored a red ball initially, his next
legal object is a color, and as long as reds remain on the table
he must alternate his play between reds and colors (though within
each group he may play a ball of his choice). When reds remain on
the table and a color is his object, the striker must (a)
designate prior to stroking which color ball is his object (that
specific color is then his &quot;ball on&quot;), and (b) cause
the cue ball's first contact with a ball to be with that colored
ball. If the striker fails to meet these requirements, it is a
foul (See Penalties For Fouls).</p>

<p><b>7.</b> If the striker's ball on is a red, and he pots a color, it
is a foul.</p>

<p><b>8.</b> If the striker's ball on is a color, and he pots any other
ball, it is a foul.</p>

<p><b>9.</b> Jump shots are illegal in International Snooker. It is a
foul if the striker intentionally causes the cue ball to jump
(rise from the bed of the table) by any means, if the jump is an
effort to clear an obstructing ball.</p>

<p><b>10.</b> While reds remain on the table, each potted color is
spotted prior to the next stroke (see Spotting Balls below for
spotting rules). After a color has been spotted, if the striker
plays while that ball is incorrectly spotted (and opponent or
referee calls it before two such plays have been taken), the shot
taken is a foul. If the striker plays two strokes after such
error without its being announced by opponent or referee, he is
free of penalty and continues playing and scoring normally as
though the spotting error simply had not occurred. The striker is
responsible for ensuring that all balls are correctly spotted
before striking. If the striker plays while a ball(s) that should
be on the table is not a foul may be awarded whenever the foul is
discovered during the striker's inning. Any scoring prior to the
discovery of the foul will count.</p>

<p><b>11.</b> When no reds remain on the table, striker's balls on
become the colors, in ascending numerical order (2,3,4,5,6,7).
These legally potted colors are not spotted after each is potted;
they remain off the table. (The black (7) ball is an exception in
the case of a tie score; see Scoring.)</p>

<p><b>Illegally Potted Ball:</b> Reds illegally potted are not
spotted; they remain off the table. Colors illegally potted are
spotted. (See Spotting Balls.)</p>

<p><b>Object Balls Jumped off the Table:</b> Reds jumped off the
table are not spotted and the striker has committed a foul.
Colors jumped off the table are spotted and the striker has
committed a foul. (See Penalties For Fouls)</p>

<p><b>Spotting Balls:</b> Reds are never spotted. Colors to be
spotted are placed as at the start of the game. If a color's spot
is occupied (to mean that to spot it would make it touch a ball),
it is placed on the spot of the highest value color that is
unoccupied. If all spots are occupied, the color is spotted as
close as possible to its original spot on a straight line between
its spot and the nearest point on the top (foot) cushion.</p>

<p><b>Cue Ball after Jumping off the Table:</b> Incoming player
has cue ball in hand within the Half Circle. When cue ball is in
hand within the Half Circle (except the opening break), there is
no restriction (based on position of reds or colors) as to what
balls may be played; striker may play at any ball on regardless
of where it is on the table.</p>

<p><b>Touching a Ball:</b> While balls are in play it is a foul
if the striker touches any object ball or if the striker touches
the cue ball with anything other than the tip during a legal
stroke.</p>

<p><b>Snookered:</b> The cue ball is snookered when a direct
stroke in a straight line to any part of every ball on is
obstructed by a ball or balls not on. If there is any one ball
that is not so obstructed, the cue ball is not snookered. If
in-hand within the Half Circle, the cue ball is snookered only if
obstructed from all positions on or within the Half Circle. If
the cue ball is obstructed by more than one ball, the one nearest
to the cue ball is the effective snookering ball.</p>

<p><b>Angled:</b> The cue ball is angled when a direct stroke in
a straight line to any part of every ball on is obstructed by a
corner of the cushion. If there is any one ball on that is not so
obstructed, the cue ball is not angled. If angled after a foul
the referee or player will state &quot;Angled Ball&quot;, and the
striker has the choice to either (1) play from that position or
(2) play from in hand within the Half Circle.</p>

<p><b>Occupied:</b> A spot is said to be occupied if a ball
cannot be placed on it without its touching another ball.</p>

<p><b>Touching Ball:</b> If the cue ball is touching another ball
which is, or can be, on, the referee or player shall state
&quot;Touching Ball.&quot; Thereafter the striker must play away
from it or it is a push stroke (foul). No penalty is incurred for
thus playing away if (1) the ball is not on; the ball is on and
the striker nominates such ball; or (3) the ball is on and the
striker nominates, and first hits, another ball. [If the referee
considers that a touching ball has moved through an agency other
than the player, it is not a foul.] </p>

<p><b>Push Stroke:</b> A push stroke is a foul and is made when
the tip of the cue remains in contact with the cue ball (1) when
the cue ball makes contact with the object ball, or (2) after the
cue ball has commenced its forward motion. Provided that where
the cue ball and an object ball are almost touching, it shall be
deemed a legal stroke if the cue ball hits the finest possible
edge of the object ball.</p>

<p><b>Miss:</b> The striker shall to the best of his ability
endeavor to hit the ball on. If the referee considers the rule
infringed he shall call foul and a &quot;miss.&quot; The incoming
player (1) may play the ball(s) as they lie, or (2) may request
that the ball(s) be returned to the original position and have
the offending player play the stroke again. Note: if the ball on
cannot possibly be hit, the striker is judged to be attempting to
hit the ball on.</p>

<p><b>Free Ball:</b> After a foul, if the cue ball is snookered,
the referee or player shall state &quot;Free Ball.&quot; If the
non-offending layer takes the next stroke he may nominate any
ball as on. For this stroke, such ball shall be regarded as, and
acquire the value of, the ball on. It is a foul should the cue
ball fail to first hit, or - except when only the pink and black
remain on the table - be snookered by, the free ball. If the
&quot;free ball&quot; is potted, is is spotted, and the value of
the ball on is scored. if the ball on is potted it is scored. If
both the &quot;free ball&quot; and the ball on are potted, only
the value of the ball on is scored.</p>

<h2>Fouls</h2>

<p>If a foul is committed:</p>

<p>1. the player who committed the foul incurs the penalty
prescribed (which is added to the opponent's score), and has to
play again if requested by the next player. Once such a request
has been made it cannot be withdrawn. <br>
2. should more than one foul be committed in the same stroke the
highest value penalty shall be incurred. <br>
3. any ball improperly spotted shall remain where positioned,
except that if off the table it shall be correctly spotted.</p>

<p>Penalties for Fouls</p>

<p>The following are fouls and incur a penalty of four points or
the higher one prescribed:</p>
