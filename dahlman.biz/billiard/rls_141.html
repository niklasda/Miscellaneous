<p align="center">Except when clearly contradicted by these additional rules,
the <a href="rls_gen.html">General Rules </a>of Pocket Billiards
apply.</p>

<hr>

<p><b>1.1. OBJECT OF THE GAME.</b> 14.1 is a nomination game. The
player must nominate a ball and a pocket. The player is awarded
one point for every correctly nominated and pocketed ball on a
legal stroke, and is allowed to continue his turn until he either
fails to pocket a nominated ball or commits a foul. The player
can pocket the first 14 balls, but before he can continue his
turn by shooting at the 15th (and last remaining) ball on the
table, the 14 pocketed balls are racked as before, except with
the apex space vacant. The player then attempts to pocket the
15th ball in a manner so that the racked balls are disturbed and
he can continue his run. </p>

<p>The player who scores the pre-determined point total for a
game (usually 150 in major tournament play or any agreed upon
total in casual play) prior to his opponent, wins the game. </p>

<p><b>2. PLAYERS.</b> 2, or 2 teams. </p>

<p><b>3. BALLS USED.</b> Standard set of object balls numbered
1-15, plus cue ball. </p>

<p><b>4. THE RACK.</b> Standard triangle rack with the apex ball
on the foot spot, 1-ball on the racker's right corner, 5-ball on
left corner. Other balls are placed at random and must touch
their neighbors. </p>

<p><b>5. SCORING.</b> Any ball legally pocketed counts one point
for the shooter. </p>

<p><b>6. OPENING BREAK.</b> Starting player must either (1)
designate a ball and a pocket into which that ball will be
pocketed and accomplish the shot, or (2) cause the cue ball to
contact a ball and then a cushion, plus cause two object balls to
contact a cushion. Failure to meet at least one of the above
requirements is a breaking violation. Offender's score is
assessed a two point penalty for each breaking violation. In
addition, the opponent has the choice of (1) accepting the table
in position, or (2) having the balls reracked and requiring the
offending player to repeat the opening break. That choice
continues until the opening break is not a breaking violation, or
until the opponent accepts the table in position. The three
successive fouls rule does not apply to breaking violations. </p>

<p>If the starting player scratches on a legal opening break, he
is charged with a foul and assessed a one point penalty, which
applies toward the &quot;Successive Fouls Penalties.&quot; The
incoming player is awarded cue ball in hand behind the head
string, with object balls in position. </p>

<p><b>7. RULES OF PLAY.</b> </p>

<ol>
    <li>A legally pocketed ball entitles a shooter to continue at
        the table until he fails to legally pocket a called ball
        on a shot. A player may shoot any ball he chooses, but
        before he shoots, must designate the called ball and
        called pocket. He need not indicate any detail such as
        kisses, caroms, combinations, or cushions (all of which
        are legal). any additionally pocketed ball(s) on a legal
        stroke is scored as one point for the shooter. </li>
    <li>On all shots, a player must cause the cue ball to contact
        an object ball and then (1) pocket a numbered ball, or
        (2) cause the cue ball or any numbered ball to contact a
        cushion. Failure to meet these requirements is a foul.<br>
        When an object ball is not frozen to a cushion, but is
        within a ball's width of a cushion (referee to determine
        by measurement if necessary), a player is permitted only
        two consecutive legal safeties on that ball using only
        the near rail. If such safety play is employed, that
        object ball is then considered frozen to the rail on the
        player's next inning. The <a href="rls_gen.html">General
        Rules </a>of Pocket Billiards &quot;Frozen Balls&quot;
        requirements apply if the player chooses to make his
        first cue ball contact with that object ball on his third
        shot. <br>
        (Note: If a player has committed a foul on the shot
        immediately before or the shot immediately after playing
        this ball, then he must immediately meet the requirements
        of the &quot;Frozen Ball&quot; rule when playing this
        object ball. Also, if he has committed two consecutive
        fouls, he must immediately meet the requirements of the
        &quot;Frozen Ball&quot; rule when playing this object
        ball. If such player fails to meet the requirements of
        the &quot;Frozen Ball&quot; rule, he is considered to
        have committed a third successive foul and the
        appropriate point penalty is assessed as well as one
        point for each of the previous fouls. All fifteen balls
        are then reracked and the player committing the
        infraction is required to break as at the beginning of
        the game.) </li>
    <li>When the fourteenth ball of a rack is pocketed, play
        stops momentarily with the fifteenth ball remaining in
        position on the table; the fourteen pocketed balls are
        then racked (with the space at the foot spot vacant in
        the triangle). Player then continues, normally pocketing
        the fifteenth (or &quot;break&quot; ball) in such manner
        as to have the cue ball carom into the rack and spread
        the balls to facilitate the continuance of his run.
        However, player is not compelled to shoot the fifteenth
        ball; he may shoot any ball he desires. </li>
    <li>A player may call a safety rather than an object ball
        (for defensive purposes). Safety play is legal, but must
        comply with all applicable rules. Player's inning ends
        when a safety is played, and pocketed balls are not
        scored. Any object ball pocketed on a called safety is
        spotted. </li>
    <li>A player may not catch, touch, or in any way interfere
        with a ball as it travels toward a pocket or the rack
        area on a shot (to include catching a ball as it enters a
        pocket by having a hand in the pocket). If he does, he is
        charged with a special &quot;deliberate foul&quot; and is
        penalized one point for the foul and an additional
        fifteen point penalty, for a total of sixteen points. The
        incoming player then has choice of (1) accepting the
        table in position with the cue ball in hand behind the
        head string, or (2) having all fifteen balls reracked and
        requiring the offending player to shoot under the
        requirements of the opening break. </li>
    <li>If the fifteenth (unpocketed) ball of a rack and/or the
        cue ball interferes with the triangle being lowered
        straight down into position for racking, refer to the
        diagram , which indicates the proper manner of relocating
        balls. (The lined out boxes are those situations in which
        there is no interference, both balls remain in position.)
    </li>
    <li>When a player has the cue ball in hand behind the head
        string (as after a scratch) and all object balls are
        behind the head string, the object ball nearest the head
        string may be spotted at his request. If two or more
        balls are an equal distance from the head string, the
        player may designate which of the equidistant balls he
        desires to have spotted. </li>
</ol>

<p align="center"><b>14.1 - What to do if:</b><br>
<img src="images/rls_141c.gif" alt="What to do if, Chart" border="0" width="703" height="293">
</p>

<p><b>8. ILLEGALLY POCKETED BALLS.</b> All spotted. No penalty. </p>

<p><b>9. OBJECT BALLS JUMPED OFF THE TABLE.</b> The stroke is a
foul. Any jumped ball(s) is spotted after the balls come to rest.
</p>

<p><b>10. CUE BALL AFTER JUMPING OFF THE TABLE OR SCRATCH.</b>
Incoming player has cue ball in hand behind the head string,
unless the provision of Rule of Play 7.2., 7.5. or 12.&quot;
(below) apply to the offender's foul and dictate alternate
choices or procedures. </p>

<p><b>11. PENALTIES FOR FOULS.</b> One point deducted for each
foul; NOTE: more severe penalties for deliberate fouls (Rule of
Play 7.5.) and third &quot;Successive Fouls&quot; (12. below).
Incoming player accepts cue ball in position unless foul was a
jumped cue ball, pocket scratch, deliberate foul (Rule of Play
7.5.) or third successive foul. </p>

<p><b>12. SUCCESSIVE FOUL PENALTIES.</b> When a player commits a
foul, he is penalized one point (or more as appropriate) and a
notation is made and posted by the scorer that he is &quot;on a
foul.&quot; The player remains &quot;on a foul&quot; until his
next shot attempt, at which time he may remove the foul by
successfully pocketing a called ball, or completing a legal
safety. If he fails to meet these requirements on his next turn
at the table, he is penalized one point. The notation is changed
to &quot;on two fouls.&quot; If he fails to meet the requirements
of successfully pocketing a called ball or completing a legal
safety on his third consecutive turn at the table, a penalty of
fifteen points is assessed. </p>

<p>The commission of a third successive foul automatically clears
the offender's record of fouls. </p>

<p>All balls are then reracked and the player committing the
infraction is required to break as at the beginning of the game.
Rules for the opening break apply. </p>

<p>It should be emphasized that successive fouls must be
committed in successive turns (or playing attempts), not merely
in successive innings. For example, if a player ends inning 6
with a foul, steps to the table for inning 7 and fouls (he is
&quot;on two fouls&quot;), and then starts inning 8 with a
legally pocketed ball before scratching on his second shot
attempt of the inning, he has not committed three successive
fouls, even though there were fouls in three successive innings.
As soon as he legally pocketed the ball to start inning 8, he
cleared the two fouls. he is, of course, &quot;on one foul&quot;
when he plays the first stroke attempt of inning 9. </p>

<p><b>13. SCORING NOTE.</b> The deduction of penalty points can
result in negative scores. A running score can read &quot;minus
one,&quot; &quot;minus two,&quot; &quot;minus fifteen,&quot; etc.
(a player can win a game with a score of 150 while his opponent
has scored but two fouls. The final score would read 150 to -2.) </p>

<p>If a player fouls on a shot that has not pocketed a ball, the
point penalty is deducted from his score at the end of the
previous inning. If a player fouls and pockets a ball on the same
shot, that ball is spotted (not scored) and the point penalty is
deducted from his score at the end of the previous inning. </p>
